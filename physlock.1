.SH NAME
physlock \- lock all consoles / virtual terminals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B physlock
.RB [ \-dhLlmsv ]
.RB [ \-p
.IR MSG ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
physlock is an alternative to vlock, it is equivalent to `vlock \-an'. It is
written because vlock blocks some linux kernel mechanisms like hibernate and
suspend and can therefore only be used with some limitations.
.P
physlock is designed to be lightweight, but highly depends on the kernels ioctl
API.
.P
The behaviour of physlock is completely controlled via command-line arguments,
it does not rely on environment variables.
physlock uses the utmp file to identify the owner of the current session (i.e.
active tty) and prompts for her password to unlock the computer.
